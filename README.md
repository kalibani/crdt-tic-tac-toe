# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


  ## How to Run:
- clone the repository
- enter to the crdt-tic-tac-toe directory
- hit npm i && npm run dev

 ## Try the live version here : https://crdt-tic-tac-toe-one.vercel.app/
- open 2 window of chrome
- start play and spot the live changes
  
this simple game are using Yjs as the CRDT model as shared data types that can be manipulated concurrently.
